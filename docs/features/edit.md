### Window layout

The window is split into two resizable panels:

| Panel | Description |
|---|---|
| **Left — Rules** | Tree of categories and their rules. Each rule shows its type icon, find pattern, replacement, and an optional description. |
| **Right — Fixes** | Preview of all lines that will be changed. The **Before** column highlights removed characters in red and the **After** column highlights added characters in green. Selecting a row reveals an **Applied rules** detail panel at the bottom listing every rule that matched that line. |

### Rule types

Each rule has one of three match types, shown as an icon in the tree:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Case insensitive | Plain text match, ignores case |
| Case sensitive | Plain text match, exact case |
| Regular expression | Full .NET regex syntax |

### Managing categories

Right-click a category node to open its context menu:

- **Edit** — rename the category
- **New category** — add a sibling category
- **New rule** — add a rule to this category
- **Move up / Move down** — reorder categories
- **Delete** — remove the category and all its rules
- **Import** — load rules from a `.template` file (JSON or legacy SE4 XML)
- **Export** — save selected categories to a `.template` file

### Managing rules

Right-click a rule node to open its context menu:

- **Edit rule** — change find/replace text, type, and description
- **Duplicate** — insert a copy of the rule above the current one
- **Insert before / Insert after** — add a new rule relative to this one
- **Move up / Move down** — reorder within the category
- **Delete** — remove the rule

Double-clicking a rule also opens the **Edit rule** dialog.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+N` | Add a new rule to the selected category, or insert after the selected rule |
| `Ctrl+D` | Duplicate the selected rule |
| `Ctrl+F` | Find a rule by name / text |
| `Ctrl+-` | Collapse all categories |
| `Ctrl++` | Expand all categories |
| `Delete` | Delete the selected rule (focus must be in the rules tree) |
| `Space` | Toggle the selected node (category or rule) on/off |
| `Escape` | Close the window |
| `F1` | Open help |

The expand/collapse buttons (`+` / `−`) above the tree expand or collapse all categories at once (`Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-`).

### Import / Export

Rule sets are stored as JSON `.template` files and can be shared across installations. The export dialog lets you choose which categories to include. SE4-format XML files can also be imported.
